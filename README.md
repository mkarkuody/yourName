Some time we wonder what our name’s root or nationality can be, or it’s fun to know how a computer can guess our age according our name. this application simply gets the name and guess your age and your name nationality.
The main idea for this project was from 3 of my classmates and I in University of Washington web developing Bootcamp, and the idea for the name of this project comes from a Japaniese animation “Your name” and I soon I started the project, I knew that “Your name”  can be a good for it.
